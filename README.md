# -MyLibft
LIBFT project at school 21. C

My implementation of some of the Standard C Library

# -How does it work?
The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

To create that library, after downloading/cloning this project, cd into the project and run:

    $ make
    
You can test my library with war-machine, libftTester or libft-unit-test.
